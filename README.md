### About 

This website was created to find animal species by location and km radius using leaflet, as well as the INaturalist and OpenStreetMap API's and then interpret the information using javascript in order to display the animals using a map and images.

It contains a data.js file that hold a list of hundreds of animals, this was done using a sample of the API iNaturalist (one of the worlds best specie observatoin apps used by scientists). Observations.js is then used to filter and format the tremendous amount of data from the API.

 The result is a free database of wildlife sightings around the world.
 
 I am using this data to create a virtual nature walk, highlighting plants, animals, insects, and more near Seneca Newnham Campuses many forest areas.
